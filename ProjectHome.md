A little java code to manage incoming and outcoming sms from mySQL to a serial modem (tested only with digicom pocket gsm).
This was created keeping in mind a fm radio situation where the speker needs an intranet's webpage where is possible to read all sms that listeners sended to the radio.

In general this program gets sms from gsm modem and store them in a mysql database and sends sms from database to the modem. A sort of low trafic sms-getaway

A php test GUI is also provided. You only need a compatible modem, a webserver and a mysql db.

Uses jsmsengine and rxtx libs.
